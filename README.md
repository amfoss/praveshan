# Introduction
Greetings, fellow tech enthusiasts. Praveshan is the first step that you need to take to become a member at amFOSS. To get accepted, you will be required to complete a set of tasks that will test your problem-solving skills, determination, and most importantly - The ability to learn how to learn.

The goal of these tasks is not to alienate those without a background in computer science but to get yourself acquainted with the process of acquiring skills on your own, all tasks are designed in a way so as to promote active learning. You could take a look at the previous-year’s challenges to get a rough idea of the process, but of course, do not expect the same questions.

- [S0](#ii.-for-pre-college-participants-s0) (for those wanting to get in before joining Amrita)

# Guidelines
#### **Google is your best friend**
Students are encouraged to learn how to use Google efficiently and try their best to be self-sufficient in solving the problems they face while doing the tasks. While mentors will be assigned to you during Praveshan to clear your doubts, self-reliance is an important skill that we look for in members.
#### **Plagiarism and copy-pasting from AI are strictly prohibited**
While referring to online sources like websites, and blogs and even taking help from AI like chatGPT are allowed, directly copying code from them is prohibited. Plagiarism checkers will be employed to make sure that all work done is genuine. 
In addition to this, sharing code between participants is strictly forbidden; if this is discovered, both parties will immediately be disqualified.
#### **Avoid using Windows/GUI tools**
Considering that amFOSS is at its heart an open-source club, you must use a Linux/macOS system to complete the tasks. You should also try to minimize the use of the mouse, and try to use the terminal to do whatever work that you need to do. 
#### **Communicate effectively**
Clearly communicate your thought process, challenges faced and progress to the mentors assigned to you during Praveshan. The ability to communicate effectively is essential for fostering collaboration and understanding.
