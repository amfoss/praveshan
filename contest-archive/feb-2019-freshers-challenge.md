# Feb 2019 - Fresher's Challenge

**Participants** : First Years - Even Semester, 2022 Batch

Follow the below tasks and submit an ISSUE in this repository so that we can check your progress among all the people.

### Base Rules

**You are not allowed to use GUI-based navigation/operations like Editing, Unzipping, etc., but are excepted to find out a solution with your coding and commanding skills** - you are accountable to show us `proof of work`, by creating your own repository named `tasks-amfoss` which will contain whatever work you do for the test. Push all your codes and screenshots to that repository. For avoiding malpractice, make your repository as _private_ so that no one can take your code. Make it _public_ before you submit.

**Plagiarism will not be entertained** - You are allowed to refer to any online portal, tutorials, forum-answers etc. but copying your code from your friends \(or as such from any online source\) is strictly forbidden.

**Note that Individuals can be disqualified from the test at the organizers' discretion.** Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the competition rules, or other unsporting behaviors.

### The Tasks

#### 2. Oswald and his Foolish Photographer

Oswald and Weenie want their picture to be hanged on the wall, but their foolish photographer he gave them a manipulated image. Can you help them to fix it? Btw, they also wanted it to be a Grayscale image. So, get started and earn some _Good Karma_. :\)

You will get the picture by running this below command.

#### 3. Correct your Emails

Last night, someone from DPRK had sneaked into our system and manipulated all of your emails in our records. We are unsure of the mistakes that might have crept in and we want you guys to fix them for us. We host our records right here in this repository, in a markdown file in this repository. Go ahead and correct _your_ email. Create a branch named `#2-<email>-fix` and send a PR. Remember to have a meaningful commit message, ofc 😁 . 

See ISSUE [\#2](https://github.com/amfoss/amfoss-freshers-test/issues/2)

> **Help**: [Git Branch](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-branch/1.7.10), [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests)

#### 4. Here is an exciting Contest!

We know that you all love Problem Solving, and we have planned a special contest for you! Are you ready?  
Oops, we have a slight problem! We have lost the link generated in the morning and we have contacted the Police to find it. Maybe you should try too \(You guys are problem-solvers after all\). Until then, you can proceed to solve the below challenges 👇 . 

> BTW, remember that the Hackerrank challenge link always starts with the URL, [https://www.hackerrank.com/](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

#### 5. Kim's Gift

Did you try to open the `hahahaha` file yet? It was left by the DPRK attacker last night, maybe it contains Kim's nuke or some chocolates for you. Who doesn't like chocolates?

Write a bash script which does the whole thing, in the end.

> **Help**   
> `file a` gives you the details about the file _a_   
> `touch a` will create new file _a_   
> `rmdir a` deletes directory _a_   
> `mv a b` transfers the contents of file _a_ to _b_   
> `chgrp` changes the group ownership of files   
> For more, you can refer at [CLI Commands](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_Unix/Commands/File_System_Utilities)

#### 6. Doval's Secret Agents

Now comes the most interesting task of all. Wait, before starting I want to ask if you got the SECRET\_MESSAGE.

```text
if(SECRET_MESSAGE):
  task.proceed()
else:
  SECRET_MESSAGE.search()
```

The task is simple, host a small website on GitHub pages saying that **SECRET\_MESSAGE is "\#\#\#"** in a Level 3 Header. You can use README or HTML. We don't bother about design but who doesn't like good websites 😉 .

> **Help**: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

#### 7. Post it!

We hope you all have a blog. You can write a blog post on your overall experience and how did you solve the tasks. Remember this is also a task but will be evaluated later. You can share the links in the Telegram group along with your status updates at the end of the day.

You can update it later in the ISSUE submission.

> **Reference**: You can have a look at some of the previous blog posts of the club members like [https://kalidindiamitraja.wordpress.com/2018/10/25/sending-email-with-python/](https://kalidindiamitraja.wordpress.com/2018/10/25/sending-email-with-python/)[https://anandinblog.wordpress.com/2018/09/10/dual-booting-ubuntu-with-windows/](https://anandinblog.wordpress.com/2018/09/10/dual-booting-ubuntu-with-windows/)

#### 8. Race it, Raise it!

Once you are done with the 7 tasks above, you are **required** to submit **all your work** which includes your code \(or maybe even screenshots\) so that we can verify that you completed the tasks. To do that, you must raise an issue in the repository and fill the template.

Here are some more rules \(we know you are pro's, just be sure of these\) -

1. Every individual should submit an **ISSUE** and fill that template so that we can evaluate the test.
2. The **ISSUE TEMPLATE** must be strictly followed. A submission without following the template will be considered as**INVALID** and hence will not be evaluated.
3. Only a single issue has to be made for each individual, multiple submissions will not be considered.
